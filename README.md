HiFi Prototype: Audio Sentiment Analysis

This prototype is focused on building a system for audio sentiment analysis, which aims to determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in audio recordings. The goal is to experiment with different machine learning models to find the most effective approach for this task.

During the iterative development process, the following models are explored:

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
   - CNNs are well-suited for processing audio data, as they can capture local features and patterns in the audio spectrum.
   - The prototype explores the use of 1D or 2D CNNs to extract relevant features from the audio signals.

2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):
   - RNNs, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are designed to handle sequential data, which aligns well with the temporal nature of audio signals.
   - The prototype investigates the performance of LSTM or other RNN architectures in capturing the dynamic and contextual information in the audio data.

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM):
   - SVMs are a classic machine learning algorithm that can be effective for classification tasks, including audio sentiment analysis.
   - The prototype compares the performance of SVMs with the neural network-based models, particularly in cases where the training dataset is relatively small.

4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):
   - LSTM is a specific type of RNN that is adept at learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, which can be beneficial for audio analysis.
   - The prototype explores the use of LSTM networks, either standalone or in combination with other models, to capture the temporal dynamics of the audio signals.

5. Random Forest:
   - Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that can be effective for a variety of classification tasks.
   - The prototype includes experiments with Random Forest to understand its performance compared to the neural network-based models and SVMs.

The iterative development process involves training and evaluating these models on a dataset of audio recordings with associated sentiment labels. The performance of each model is assessed using relevant metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The insights gained from these experiments help the team to identify the most suitable model or combination of models for the audio sentiment analysis task.

The goal is to develop a robust and accurate audio sentiment analysis system that can be integrated into various applications, such as customer service, content moderation, or personal assistants, to provide valuable insights into the emotional state of users based on their voice interactions.
